Structure of data: Each row represents a singular passing play (including sacks). 

There are 3 R files in this repository. load_data.R is the provided file which compiles the data, and writes it to a csv (which is then read by explore.R). 
eda.R is a file full of helper functions that are used to quickly make graphs (most of them just require the data frame and the variable to be graphed). 
explore.R utilizes the helper functions and explores the data. Any interesting observations made when running the graphs are written in the comments for explore.R. 
The final conclusions on the observations is also in comments at the bottom of the explore.R file.
